Getting a Git Repository
    You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
        You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
        You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project

$ git init
    This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your 
    project  is tracked yet. 

If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit.
$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'initial project version'
At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.


Cloning an Existing Repository
$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
