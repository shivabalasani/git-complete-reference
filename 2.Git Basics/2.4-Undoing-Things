Undoing Things
One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. 
If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option:

$ git commit --amend

The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as always, 
but it overwrites your previous commit.
